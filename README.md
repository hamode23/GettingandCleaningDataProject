# Getting and Cleaning Data

## Course Project tasks

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## How to excute this project:

1. Download the source data and put into a folder on your local drive. You will have a "UCI HAR Dataset" folder.
2. Set your working diroctery to the same local drive (where you saved the source data).
2. Save "run_analysis.R" in the your local drive.
3. Run source("run_analysis.R"). Once done , it will generate a new file called "tiny_data.txt" in your working directory.
